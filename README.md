# web2product-catalog
A fault-tolerant, concurrent Python scraper that transforms company websites into structured product catalogs. Starting from a homepage, it uses a headless browser to crawl internal links, converts HTML to Markdown, and leverages a local LLM (via Ollama) to extract product names, descriptions, page URLs, and a company-level summary.
